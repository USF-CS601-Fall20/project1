/** The main class for project 1.
 * The main function should take the following 4 command line arguments:
 * -hotels hotelFile -reviews reviewsDirectory
 * (Note: they can also be provided in the opposite order, first -reviews reviewsDirectory,
 * then -hotels hotelFile)
 *
 * The program should read general information about the hotels from the hotelFile (a JSON file)
 * and recursively traverse reviewsDirectory and read hotel review files.
 * The data should be loaded into data structures that allow efficient search.
 * The user should be able to enter commands via keyboard input to interact with hotel data.
 * See project description posted on Canvas for details.
 *
 * You are expected to add other classes and methods to this project.
